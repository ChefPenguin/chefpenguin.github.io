Hey everyone! This is just a quick little introduction to Linux Mint for those thinking about hopping off of the Windows train.

# What is Linux Mint?

Linux Mint is a distribution of Linux aimed primarily at the crowd that wants something that "just works". With little to no configuration, without touching a command line, you can easily set up an environment with:
- Web browsing
- Word processing
- Spreadsheets
- A powerful image manipulation tool
- A Zoom client

## Installation

Installation is extremely simple. Provide a username and password for a user account, specify where you want it to be installed, and let the installer do the work.

>[!NOTE] Unless you specifically instruct it otherwise, it *will* overwrite any data on the drive you decide to install it on. 

## Basic Productivity Applications

Linux Mint has an app store, not dissimilar to the one that Apple uses. For everyday usage, I'd recommend: 
- LibreOffice, a suite of programs similar to Microsoft Office, but open-source
  - An alternative with an interface closer to Microsoft Office is OnlyOffice, but it's a little less well-supported.
- GIMP - an image manipulation program like Photoshop.
- Google Chrome - exactly what it sounds like. Firefox works too, but it's been falling behind recently.
Steam is also available on the store, but Mint isn't particularly well known for its out-of-the-box functionality with gaming or Nvidia cards, so your mileage may vary.
