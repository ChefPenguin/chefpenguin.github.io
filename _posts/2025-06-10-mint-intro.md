Hey everyone! This is just a quick little introduction to Linux Mint for those thinking about hopping off of the Windows train.

# What is Linux Mint?

Linux Mint is a distribution of Linux aimed primarily at the crowd that wants something that "just works". With little to no configuration, without touching a command line, you can easily set up an environment with:
- Web browsing
- Word processing
- Spreadsheets
- A powerful image manipulation tool
- A Zoom client

## Installation

Installation is extremely simple. Provide a username and password for a user account, specify where you want it to be installed, and let the installer do the work.

> Unless you specifically instruct it otherwise, it *will* overwrite any data on the drive you decide to install it on. If you're uncomfortable or unsure, I'd recommend moving any important stuff to an external drive. 

## Basic Productivity Applications

Linux Mint has an app store, not dissimilar to the one that Apple uses. For everyday usage, I'd recommend: 

- LibreOffice, a suite of programs similar to Microsoft Office, but open-source
  - An alternative with an interface closer to Microsoft Office is OnlyOffice, but it's a little less well-supported.
- GIMP - an image manipulation program like Photoshop.
- Google Chrome - exactly what it sounds like. Firefox works too, but it's been falling behind recently.

Steam is also available on the store, but Mint isn't particularly well known for its out-of-the-box functionality with gaming or Nvidia cards, so your mileage may vary.

## Getting On With It

Now that you're running Linux, you have much more freedom and flexibility than you may be used to. Your desktop will rarely, if ever, change unless you make the change yourself. And if you one day decide that your desktop doesn't look right, you can change it however you want. 
Cinnamon, the default Desktop Environment (DE) that Mint uses, is Windows-like to make it easy for people to transition to, but you can freely download and deploy whatever environment you'd like. 
- KDE Plasma is well-regarded for being easy to customize and extremely flexible
- Gnome is unintrusive and rocksteady, there when you want it, out of the way when you don't, and unlikely to spontaneously combust.
- Xfce is *extremely* lightweight. It's not the most feature-rich, but if all you need is *a desktop*, this will do it and do it well.
